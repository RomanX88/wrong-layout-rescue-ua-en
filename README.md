# Wrong Layout Rescue (UA-EN)

Ever realized you've been typing a paragraph in the wrong keyboard layout? This tool rescues your text by converting between Ukrainian and English layouts based on key positions. No more retyping!

## How It Works

Just paste text typed in the wrong keyboard layout, click "Convert," and get the correctly laid-out text instantly. The tool maps each key press to its equivalent position on the other keyboard layout.

## Usage

1. Open the HTML file in any web browser
2. Enter text in the left input field
3. Click "Convert"
4. Copy your converted text from the right field

## Examples

- "Ghbdsn" (typed with English layout) → "Привіт" (Ukrainian)
- "Руддщ" (typed with Ukrainian layout) → "Hello" (English)
